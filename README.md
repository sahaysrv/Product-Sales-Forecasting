## Sales Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview - This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict sales based on historical data from multiple stores across various regions and store types. The dataset contains information about store characteristics, holiday periods, and the number of orders, which will be leveraged to create predictive models that can forecast future sales.
